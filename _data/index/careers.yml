#      <ul>
#      <li>Developed a novel Non-convex optimization algorithm to attack the rise of model complexity in large-scale kernalized SVMs.
#      The algorithm was an amalgamation of fast approximate training achieved by Budget Maintenance strategies on the number of support vectors
#      and enhanced optimization scheme offered by Adaptive Coordinate Frequency method on Coordinate Descent method by a non-uniform selection of coordinate frequencies.</li>
#      <li>Devised a new stopping criterion for this non-convex problem to halt the optimization algorithm, instead of running it for certain number of epochs.</li>
